Pictorial Loop Invariants

Write-up

1.
Partition arranges code from left to right by comparing to a pivot value.
The exit condition accordingly is to compare l_spot and r_spot until the
the two values are next to each other or equal to each other in the array 
and we have eliminated a middle. In code this looks like:

(l_spot <= r_spot)

This is correct because the variable r_spot gives the location, so that 
a[r_spot+1], ..., a[right] are all >= a[left], and a[left+1], ..., a[l_spot-1]
are all <= a[left]. Therefore once l_spot has passed r_spot, all the necessary
values have been checked so we can exit.

6.
For both invariants, we will use the following three variables to record the indices of the borders for the colors:

left
middle
right

For invariant B:
left, represents the first element unchecked outside of the red section (between red and white). 
middle,  represents the first element unchecked outside of the white section (between white and unprocessed)
right, represents the first element prior to the blue section.

For invariant C:
left, represents the first element right outside of the red section (between red and unprocessed). 
middle, represents the first element unchecked outside of the unprocessed section (between unprocessed and white)
right, represents the first element prior to the blue section.

9.Everytime DutchNationalFlag.java is run, it will randomly generate an array of type color, print that unsorted array, sort that array, and print the sorted array. We ran it several times
each time generating different arrays and made sure those arrays were sorted.
